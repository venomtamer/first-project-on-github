            <p>This seemingly simple question doesn't have a simple answer. Everyone knows that Earth, Mars and Jupiter are planets. But both Pluto and Ceres were once considered planets until new discoveries triggered scientific debate about how to best describe themâ€”a vigorous debate that continues to this day. The most recent definition of a planet was adopted by the International Astronomical Union in 2006. </p>
